HTML SYNTAX it uses tags which are enclosed with <p> , and the closing tag </p> and the content n between the opening and closing taps 
HTML ELEMENTS these tags can work with elements like paragraghs containing contents.

Also there is a cae where we got paragragh with both tags but inside the paragragh there part that is emphasized which turned to seperate element that is opened and closed by tags <p> this a paragragh <em> emphasized text</em></p>
HTML PARAGRAGHS the paragraghs is indicated by tags ( <p> and </p>) which are opening and closing which identify the its a single paragragh
