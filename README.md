Cascading style sheets(CSS) is the style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of the documents  written in markup language <br>
HTML SYNTAX it uses tags which are p that are enclosed by less and greater , and the closing tag  and the content n between the opening and closing taps <br>
HTML ELEMENTS these tags can work with elements like paragraghs containing contents.<br>
also some of these elements require both opening, closing tags and other does not need closing tags <br> 
Also there is a cae where we got paragragh with both tags but inside the paragragh there part that is emphasized which turned to seperate element that is opened and closed by tags "p" this a paragragh "em" emphasized text <br>
HTML PARAGRAGHS the paragraghs is indicated by tags "p" and "/p" which are opening and closing which identify the its a single paragragh and are closed by less and greater <br>
HTML HEADLINES they come with six defferent type such as h1 to h6 and h1 is the largest and most prominent and h6 is smallest <br>
Also they start with opening tag and close tag at the end <br>
